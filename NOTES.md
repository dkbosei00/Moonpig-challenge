# Project Notes

## Current Implementation

- Implemented a Node.js backend with Express.js
- Created two main endpoints: `/cards` and `/cards/:cardId/:sizeId?`
- Used axios for making HTTP requests to fetch data
- Implemented error handling for various scenarios
- Separated business logic into service functions
- Added Husky for testing anytime a `git commit` is made
- Used Jest for testing

## Potential Improvements

Given more time, the following enhancements could be made to the project:

### Caching

- Implement a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to store fetched data
- This would reduce API calls and improve response times

### Additional API Endpoints
Given more time, we could implement the following additional API endpoints:

1. **Create New Card**
   - Endpoint: `POST /cards`
   - Functionality: Allow users to create new card designs
   - Implementation:
     - Validate incoming data
     - Generate a unique ID for the new card
     - Store the new card data (would require a database implementation)
     - Return the newly created card details

2. **Update Existing Card**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /cards/:cardId`
   - Functionality: Allow users to update existing card designs
   - Implementation:
     - Validate incoming data
     - Find the existing card by ID
     - Update the card details
     - Return the updated card information

3. **Delete Card**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /cards/:cardId`
   - Functionality: Allow users to delete existing cards
   - Implementation:
     - Find the card by ID
     - Remove the card from the database
     - Return a success message

### Database Integration
- Implement a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store card data
- Create data models and implement ORM/ODM for database interactions
- Implement database migrations for version control of database schema

### API Documentation

- Use a tool like Swagger to create comprehensive API documentation
- This would make it easier for other developers to understand and use the API

### Environment Configuration

- Implement environment-based configuration using dotenv
- This would allow for easy switching between development, staging, and production environments

### Pagination

- Add pagination for the `/cards` endpoint to handle large datasets efficiently

### Error Handling

- Enhance error handling with more specific error types and messages
- Implement a global error handler middleware

### Security Enhancements
- Implement authentication and authorization for sensitive operations
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
- Implement HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission

### Logging and Monitoring
- Implement a logging system for better debugging and monitoring
- Set up application monitoring to track performance and errors in production

### Containerization
- Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scaling


These improvements would enhance the project's functionality, maintainability, and scalability.
